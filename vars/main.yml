Instead of having to write checks to 5–10 creditors every month, you consolidate bills into one payment, and write one check. This helps eliminate mistakes that result in penalties like incorrect amount or late payments.<br><br>There are three major types of debt consolidation: Debt Management Plans, Debt Consolidation Loans and Debt Settlement. These are not quick fixes, but rather long-term financial strategies to help you get out of debt.</p>"}

The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly.</p><br><p>Greater than 80% of mesothelioma is caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos.</p>"}
